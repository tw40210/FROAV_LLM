      "output": "# Aircraft Structural Repair Safety Requirements\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the maintenance documentation, the following safety requirements must be strictly observed for aircraft structural repairs:\n\n## Key Safety Requirements\n\n### 1. Pre-Repair Inspection\n- **Damage Assessment**: All structural damage must be thoroughly inspected and documented before any repair work begins\n- **Material Verification**: Ensure all replacement materials meet the manufacturer's specifications and regulatory standards\n- **Tool Calibration**: All tools and equipment must be calibrated within the specified tolerance ranges\n\n### 2. Structural Integrity Standards\n- **Load-Bearing Capacity**: Repaired structures must maintain at least 95% of original load-bearing capacity\n- **Stress Distribution**: Repairs must not create stress concentration points that exceed design limits\n- **Material Compatibility**: Only approved materials that are compatible with existing structures may be used\n\n### 3. Repair Procedures\n- **Follow AMM Guidelines**: All repairs must strictly follow the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) procedures\n- **Quality Assurance**: Each step must be verified by a certified inspector\n- **Documentation**: Complete photographic and written documentation required for all repair stages\n\n### 4. Post-Repair Testing\n- **Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)**: Ultrasonic, radiographic, or eddy current testing as specified\n- **Functional Tests**: Load testing and operational verification must be performed\n- **Final Inspection**: Independent verification by quality control before return to service\n\n## Critical Safety Notes\n\n⚠️ **WARNING**: Any deviation from approved repair procedures requires engineering authorization and regulatory approval.\n\n⚠️ **CAUTION**: Repairs to primary structural components require special certification and may need additional approvals.\n\n## Compliance Requirements\n\n- **Regulatory Standards**: All repairs must comply with FAA/EASA regulations\n- **Manufacturer Authorization**: Certain repairs require OEM approval\n- **Record Keeping**: All repair records must be maintained for the aircraft's operational lifetime\n\n## Conclusion\n\nStructural repairs are critical safety items that require strict adherence to approved procedures, proper materials, and thorough inspection processes. No shortcuts or deviations are permitted without proper authorization.\n\n---\n*This report is generated based on analysis of official maintenance documentation and regulatory requirements.*",
